This repository contains my final project for my university degree.

The project was a study on the tower defence genre, and so was the game I made to go along with it!

This was my first large project utilising a lot of different skills, old and new, so it is a little rough.

Features:
- 3 resources, each obtained through different means that can be altered by towers.
- 3 distinct tower categories that share theming and effects.
- A handful of enemy types.
- Friendly and enemy pathfinding and fighting.
- A basic system that allows for easy expansion of towers and units.
- A basic buff and debuff system

This project itself is done for now but the ideas might be used in a later project or taken in its entirety when I am more experienced in the field.
